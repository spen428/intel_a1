# A curve-fitting genetic algorithm

*March 3, 2016*

Submitted for my university's *Introduction to Intelligent Systems* course. This is a Java implementation of a genetic algorithm that attempts to fit a set of datapoints to a curve of the form $`a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + fx^5`$

The report is [here](/doc/report.pdf).

Compilation requires the *JUnit* jars to be on the classpath.
