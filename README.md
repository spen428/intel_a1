# intel_a1

Submitted for assessment 1 of the *Introduction to Intelligent Systems* course. This is a Java implementation of a genetic algorithm that attempts to fit a set of datapoints to a curve of the form `ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + ex^5`.

Compilation requires the *JUnit* jars to be on the classpath.
